# Drug-repurposing
In the search of finding new drugs for orphan diseases , we aim to use the existing drugs , by finding their compatibity scores and analyse 4 feature between the existing drug and an orphan disease :
             1. drug compatibity score
             2. disease pathway coverage
             3. drug mechanism of action vs disease target
             4. match break down with improvement suggestions 
Our AI model , by using ML is being trained to analyse the efficiency of an existing drug when interacted with an orphan disease
Our project is dived into 2 parts :
          1. analysis and summery
          2. reconstucting using the analysis provided earlier
